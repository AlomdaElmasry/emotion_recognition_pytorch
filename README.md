## Deep Learning Based Emotion Recognition With PyTorch
In this notebook we are going to learn how to train deep neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for addressing a natural language task known as emotion recognition. We will cover everything you need to know to get started with NLP using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. We will cover the common best practices, functionalities, and steps you need to understand the basics of TensorFlow APIs to build powerful predictive models via the computation graph. In the process of building our models, we will compare PyTorch and TensorFlow to let the learner appreciate the strengths of each tool.
